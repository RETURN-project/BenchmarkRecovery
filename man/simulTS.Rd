  seasAv,
  seasAmp,
  trAv,
  remSd,
  distMag,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{nyr}{number of years that need to be simulated}

\item{nobsyr}{number of observations per year that will be simulated}

\item{tMiss}{timing of missing values [observation number]. If tMiss equals NA, no missing values are introduced.}

\item{nDr}{number of drought years that are introduced [i.e. setting seasonality of a year equal to its minimum value]. These drought years are randomly chosen.}

\item{seasAv}{average seasonality profile}

\item{seasAmp}{seasonality amplitude}

\item{trAv}{offset value of time series}

\item{remSd}{standard deviation of the remainder}

\item{distMag}{magnitude of the disturbance}

\item{distT}{timing of the disturbance [observation number]}

\item{distRec}{duration of the recovery [number of observations]}

\item{distType}{type of disturbance-recovery process: 'piecewise' represents a step function with linear recovery, 'exponential' represents an exponential decay}

\item{remMod}{ARMA model of remainder}
}
\value{
a list containign the years for which a drought was introduced and a time series object, containing the simulated seasonality, trend, remainder, disturbance, and the sum of these components.
