\title{Simulate disturbance component: Simulation of a disturbance as a step function with linear recovery trend. The time series equals zero when it is not being disturbed. The disturbance introduces at observation number *distT* a negative value with magnitude *distMag*. The linear recovery takes *distRec* observations.}
\usage{
simulDist(distT, distRec, distMag, nobs)
}
\arguments{
\item{distT}{timing of the disturbance [observation number]}

\item{distRec}{duration of the recovery period [number of observations]}

\item{distMag}{magnitude of the disturbance}

\item{nobs}{number of observations per year that will be simulated}
}
\value{
a vector with the simulated disturbance component
}
