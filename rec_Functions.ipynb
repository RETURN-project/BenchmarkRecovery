The indicators are originally developped for annual long-term time series of optical vegetation indices (the indicators are shown in the figures below). Yet, in order to be able to derive the indicators as well for dense and/or short time series, a modified version is suggested. Here, the user can define the time period before, during and after the disturbance that is used to derive the indicators. To reduce the interference of the seasonal pattern of dense time series, the chosen time period should cover blocks of n years. Moreover, given the potentially high noise levels of dense time series, the mean value instead of the maximum value was used in the formulas.*\n",
